Enthusiastic student enrolled in Software Developer track at Bloc, seeking to make connections with peers and professionals in the software development field. 

As a student at Bloc, I am in the process of mastering front-end programming with HTML5, CSS3, command line, Git, GitHub, JavaScript (native, jQuery and Angular) and Firebase. As the course progresses I will be learning object oriented programming, basic programming mechanisms, and best practices for application development using Ruby on Rails.
